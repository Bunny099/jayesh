          As a Frontend Developer, I specialize in building beautiful,
          responsive, and high-performance user interfaces that feel fast and
          intuitive. My frontend stack includes HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN
          UI, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js, allowing me to create
          modern, mobile-friendly interfaces that are both accessible and
          visually consistent across devices.
          <br />
          <br />
          I focus on usability, performance, and clean codeâ€”ensuring that every
          interface I build is not only visually appealing but also optimized
          for SEO and user engagement. Whether it's landing pages, dashboards,
          or interactive web apps, I deliver pixel-perfect frontend experiences
          backed by scalable component architectures.

          Need a custom design system or integration with backend APIs? I've got
          that covered, and if you're using tools like Figma or any design
          input, I can convert those into production-grade UIs quickly and
          accurately.
