          As a Full-Stack Developer, I design and develop complete web
          applications that combine both powerful backend functionality and
          engaging frontend interfaces. My tech stack includes HTML, CSS,
          Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js,
          Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Prisma—alongside
          development tools like GitHub, Docker, and AWS for deployment and
          scalability.
          <br />
          <br />
          I build scalable, maintainable, and secure full-stack
          solutions—whether it's a dynamic SaaS platform, admin dashboard,
          e-commerce site, or real-time application using WebSockets. From
          database architecture and API design to frontend performance
          optimization and clean UI, I handle each layer of development to
          ensure seamless functionality and a great user experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm also adaptable: if a project requires different tools or
          technologies, I'm always open to learning and delivering accordingly.
          My goal is to provide complete, production-ready solutions tailored to
          your specific needs.
