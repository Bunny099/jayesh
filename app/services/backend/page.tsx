          On the backend, I engineer robust, scalable, and secure server-side systems that power dynamic applications. I work primarily with Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and WebSockets for real-time communication. For data storage, I'm experienced with both MongoDB and PostgreSQL, using Prisma ORM for efficient and type-safe database operations.
          <br /><br />
          Whether it's creating RESTful APIs, integrating third-party services, handling user authentication, or architecting complex data relationships, I ensure performance, security, and maintainability. I also use Docker for containerization and AWS for hosting and deployment, allowing the backend systems I build to scale easily with growing user demand.
          <br /><br />
          Beyond my current stack, I'm always open to learning and adapting to new technologies based on project requirements. Your backend is the foundation of your appâ€”and I make sure it's built to last.
